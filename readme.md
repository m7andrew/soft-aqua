# Soft Aqua (Sketch Resource)

![](github.com/m7andrew/soft-aqua/screenshot.png)

Soft Aqua attempts to blend of some of the best skeuomorphic design principles from macOS Cheetah to macOS Mavericks. Soft Aqua is a tribute to Apple's aqua interface and was designed for fun and nostalgia. Soft Aqua is not an exact recreation of any one version of macOS, rather its goal is to reimagine what a modern skeuomorphic aqua interface could look like.
