Soft Aqua attempts to blend of some of the best skeuomorphic design principles from macOS Cheetah to macOS Mavericks. Soft Aqua is a tribute to Apple's aqua interface and was designed for fun and nostalgia. This is not an exact re-creation of any one version of macOS, rather it's a reimagining of what a modern skeuomorphic aqua interface could look like.
